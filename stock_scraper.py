# --- Selenium Setup ---

# Set up the Chrome webdriver
# This will automatically download the correct driver for your Chrome version
driver = webdriver.Chrome(service=Service(ChromeDriverManager().install()))

# Navigate to the website (replace with the actual URL of the stock exchange)
# For demonstration, we'll use a placeholder.
# A good target would be a historical data page for a specific stock on the NSE or BSE website.
driver.get("https://www.example.com")

# --- Data Scraping (Placeholder) ---

# This is where you would add your Selenium code to scrape the data.
# You'll need to identify the HTML elements containing the data you want.
# For example, you might look for a table with historical stock prices.

# Example (replace with actual selectors):
# try:
#     table = driver.find_element(By.ID, "historical-data-table")
#     rows = table.find_elements(By.TAG_NAME, "tr")
#
#     data = []
#     for row in rows[1:]: # Skip header row
#         cols = row.find_elements(By.TAG_NAME, "td")
#         if len(cols) == 7: # Assuming a table with 7 columns (Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Adj Close, Volume)
#             data.append({
#                 'ds': cols[0].text, # Date (needs to be in YYYY-MM-DD format for Prophet)
#                 'y': float(cols[4].text.replace(',', '')) # Closing price
#             })
# except Exception as e:
#     print(f"An error occurred during scraping: {e}")


# For demonstration purposes, we'll create a dummy dataframe.
# In a real application, this would be populated with the scraped data.
scraped_data = {
    'ds': pd.to_datetime(['2023-01-01', '2023-01-02', '2023-01-03', '2023-01-04', '2023-01-05']),
    'y': [100, 102, 105, 103, 106]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(scraped_data)

# Close the browser
driver.quit()

# --- Prophet Forecasting ---

# Ensure the dataframe has the required 'ds' and 'y' columns
if 'ds' in df.columns and 'y' in df.columns:

    # Initialize the Prophet model
    model = Prophet()

    # Fit the model to the data
    model.fit(df)

    # Create a future dataframe for predictions
    # We'll predict for the next 30 days
    future = model.make_future_dataframe(periods=30)

    # Make predictions
    forecast = model.predict(future)

    # --- Output and Visualization ---

    # Print the forecast
    print("Forecasted Data:")
    print(forecast[['ds', 'yhat', 'yhat_lower', 'yhat_upper']].tail())

    # Plot the forecast
    # This will open a new window with the plot

    # Plot forecast components (trend, weekly, yearly seasonality)
    fig2 = model.plot_components(forecast)
